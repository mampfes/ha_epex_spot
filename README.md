[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

This component adds electricity prices from stock exchange [EPEX Spot](https://www.epexspot.com) to Home Assistant. [EPEX Spot](https://www.epexspot.com) does not provide free access to the data, so this component uses different ways to retrieve the data.

---

There is a companion integration which simplifies the use of EPEX Spot integration to switch on/off an application depending on the energy market prices:

## Sensors

This integration provides the following sensors:

1. Net market price
2. Market price
3. Average market price during the day
4. Median market price during the day
5. Lowest market price during the day
6. Highest market price during the day
7. Current market price quantile during the day
8. Rank of the current market price during the day

The _EPEX Spot Web Scraper_ provides some additional sensors:

- Buy Volume
- Sell Volume
- Volume

NOTE: For GB data, the prices will be shown in GBP instead of EUR. The sensor attribute names are adjusted accordingly.

### 1. Net Market Price Sensor

The sensor value reports the net market price in €/£/kWh. The price value will be updated every hour to reflect the current net market price.

The sensor attributes contains a list of all available net market prices (for today and tomorrow if available) in €/£/kWh.

```yaml
data:
  - start_time: "2022-12-15T23:00:00+00:00"
    end_time: "2022-12-16T00:00:00+00:00"
    price_per_kwh: 0.12485
  - start_time: "2022-12-16T00:00:00+00:00"
    end_time: "2022-12-16T01:00:00+00:00"
    price_per_kwh: 0.12235
  - start_time: "2022-12-16T01:00:00+00:00"
    end_time: "2022-12-16T02:00:00+00:00"
    price_per_kwh: 0.12247
```

The net market price will be calculated as follows:
`<Net Price>` = `<Market Price>` + `<Surcharges>` + `<Tax>`

- Net market price is the price you have to pay at the end, including taxes, surcharges and VAT.
- Market price is the energy price from EPEX Spot excluding taxes, surcharges, VAT.
- 2 different types of surcharges can be adjusted:
  1. Percentage Surcharge, stated in % of the EPEX Spot market price.
  2. Absolute Surcharge, stated in €/£/kWh, excluding VAT.
- Tax, e.g. VAT

The values for surcharges and tax can be adjusted in the integration configuration.

Example:

```text
Percentage Surchage = 3%
Absolute Surcharge = 0.012 €/£/kWh
Tax = 19%

Net Price = ((Market Price * 1.03) + 0.012) * 1.19
```

#### Note about smartENERGY.at

As of Feb 2024, even though smartENERGY says that the prices reported by the API already include 20% tax (meaning users would configure the sensor to add a static €0.0144 to every price value from the API), [this is incorrect, and the API reports pricing without Tax](https://github.com/mampfes/ha_epex_spot/issues/108#issuecomment-1951423366 "this is incorrect, and the API reports pricing without Tax").

To get the actual, current Net Price [listed by smartENERGY on their website](https://www.smartenergy.at/smartcontrol#:~:text=Aktueller%20Stundenpreis "listed by smartENERGY on their website"), configure:

- Absolute surcharge = €0.012
- Tax = 20%

### 2. Market Price Sensor

The sensor value reports the EPEX Spot market price in €/£/kWh. The market price doesn't include taxes, surcharges, VAT. The price value will be updated every hour to reflect the current market price.

The sensor attributes contains additional values:

- The market price in €/£/kWh.
- A list of all available market prices (for today and tomorrow if available) in  €/£/kWh.

```yaml
price_per_kwh: 0.089958
data:
  - start_time: "2022-12-15T23:00:00+00:00"
    end_time: "2022-12-16T00:00:00+00:00"
    price_per_kwh: 0.092042
  - start_time: "2022-12-16T00:00:00+00:00"
    end_time: "2022-12-16T01:00:00+00:00"
    price_per_kwh: 0.090058
  - start_time: "2022-12-16T01:00:00+00:00"
    end_time: "2022-12-16T02:00:00+00:00"
    price_per_kwh: 0.126067
```

### 3. Average Market Price Sensor

The sensor value reports the average EPEX Spot market price during the day. The sensor value reports the market price in €/£/kWh.


### 4. Median Market Price Sensor

The sensor value reports the median EPEX Spot market price during the day. The sensor value reports the market price in €/£/kWh.


### 5. Lowest Market Price Sensor

The sensor value reports the lowest EPEX Spot market price during the day. The sensor value reports the market price in €/£/kWh. The market price in €/£/kWh is available as sensor attribute.

The sensor attributes contains the start and endtime of the lowest market price timeframe.

```yaml
price_per_kwh: 0.09
start_time: "2023-02-15T22:00:00+00:00"
end_time: "2023-02-15T23:00:00+00:00"
```

### 6. Highest Market Price Sensor

The sensor value reports the highest EPEX Spot market price during the day. The sensor value reports the market price in €/£/kWh. The market price in €/£/kWh is available as sensor attribute.

The sensor attributes contains the start and endtime of the highest market price timeframe.

```yaml
price_per_kwh: 0.33
start_time: "2023-02-15T22:00:00+00:00"
end_time: "2023-02-15T23:00:00+00:00"
```

### 7. Quantile Sensor

The sensor value reports the quantile between the lowest market price and the highest market price during the day in the range between 0 & 1.

Examples:

- The sensor reports 0 if the current market price is the lowest during the day.
- The sensor reports 1 if the current market price is the highest during the day.
- If the sensor reports e.g., 0.25, then the current market price is 25% of the range between the lowest and the highest market price.

### 8. Rank Sensor

The sensor value reports the rank of the current market price during the day. Or in other words: The number of hours in which the price is lower than the current price.

Examples:

- The sensor reports 0 if the current market price is the lowest during the day. There is no lower market price during the day.
- The sensor reports 23 if the current market price is the highest during the day (if the market price will be updated hourly). There are 23 hours which are cheaper than the current hour market price.
- The sensor reports 1 if the current market price is the 2nd cheapest during the day. There is 1 one which is cheaper than the current hour market price.

## Service Calls

List of Service Calls:

- Get Lowest Price Interval
- Get Highest Price Interval
- Fetch Data

### 1. Get Lowest and Highest Price Interval

**Requires Release >= 2.0.0**

Get the time interval during which the price is at its lowest/highest point.

Knowing the hours with the lowest / highest consecutive prices during the day could be an interesting use case. This might be of value when looking for the most optimum time to start your washing machine, dishwasher, dryer, etc.

With this service call, you can let the integration calculate the optimal start time. The only mandatory attribute is the duration of your appliance. Optionally you can limit start- and end-time, e.g. to start your appliance only during night hours.

```yaml
epex_spot.get_lowest_price_interval
epex_spot.get_highest_price_interval
```

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description                                                                     | Example                          |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `device_id`            | yes      | A EPEX Spot service instance ID. In case you have multiple EPEX Spot instances. | 9d44d8ce9b19e0863cf574c2763749ac |
| `earliest_start`       | yes      | Earliest time to start the appliance.                                           | "14:00:00"                       |
| `earliest_start_post`  | yes      | Postponement of `earliest_start` in days: 0 = today (default), 1= tomorrow      | 0                                |
| `latest_end`           | yes      | Latest time to end the appliance.                                               | "16:00:00"                       |
| `latest_end_post`      | yes      | Postponement of `latest_end` in days: 0 = today (default), 1= tomorrow          | 0                                |
| `duration`             | no       | Required duration to complete appliance.                                        | See below...                     |

Notes:

- If `earliest_start` is omitted, the current time is used instead.
- If `latest_end` is omitted, the end of all available market data is used.
- `earliest_start` refers to today if `earliest_start_post` is omitted or set to 0.
- `latest_end` will be automatically trimmed to the available market area.
- If `earliest_start` and `latest_end` are present _and_ `latest_end` is earlier than (or equal to) `earliest_start`, then `latest_end` refers to tomorrow.
- `device_id` is only required if have have setup multiple EPEX Spot instances. The easiest way to get the unique device id, is to use the _Developer Tools -> Services_.

Service Call Examples:

```yaml
service: epex_spot.get_lowest_price_interval
data:
  device_id: 9d44d8ce9b19e0863cf574c2763749ac
  earliest_start: "14:00:00"
  latest_end: "16:00:00"

  earliest_start_post: 1
  latest_end: "00:00:00"
  latest_end_post: 2
  duration: "01:30:00" # 1h, 30 minutes
```

#### Response

The response contains the calculated start and end-time and the average price per kWh.

Example:

```yaml
start: "2024-11-04T23:00:00+01:00"
end: "2024-11-05T00:00:00+01:00"
price_per_kwh: 0.098192
net_price_per_kwh: 0.13223
```

With Home Assistant release >= 2023.9 you can use the [Template Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/template/) to create a sensor (in your `configuration.yaml` file) that shows the start time:

![Start Appliance Sensor](/images/start_appliance_sensor.png)

```yaml
template:
  - trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "00:00:00"
    action:
      - service: epex_spot.get_lowest_price_interval
        data:
          earliest_start: "20:00:00"
          latest_end: "23:00:00"
          duration:
            hours: 1
            minutes: 5
        response_variable: resp
    sensor:
      - name: Start Appliance
        device_class: timestamp
        state: "{{ resp.start is defined and resp.start }}"
```

This sensor can be used to trigger automations:

```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: time
    at: sensor.start_appliance
condition: []
action: []
```

### 2. Fetch Data

**Requires Release >= 2.1.0**

Fetch data from all services or a specific service.

```yaml
epex_spot.fetch_data
```

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description                                                                     | Example                          |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `device_id`            | yes      | A EPEX Spot service instance ID. In case you have multiple EPEX Spot instances. | 9d44d8ce9b19e0863cf574c2763749ac |

### 3. The EPEX Spot Sensor Integration

A significantly easier, GUI-based method to achieve some of the results listed above is to install the [EPEX Spot Sensor](https://github.com/mampfes/ha_epex_spot_sensor "EPEX Spot Sensor") integration (via HACS) and configure helpers with it. An example for this method is covered in FAQ 2 below.

## FAQ

### 1. How can I show a chart of the next hours?

With [ApexCharts](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card), you can easily show a chart like this to see the hourly net prices for today:

![apexchart](/images/apexcharts.png)

You just have to install [ApexCharts](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card) (via HACS) and enter the following data in the card configuration:

```yaml
type: custom:apexcharts-card
header:
  show: true
  title: Electricity Prices
graph_span: 48h
span:
  start: day
now:
  show: true
  label: Now
series:
  - entity: sensor.epex_spot_data_net_price
    name: Electricity Price
    type: column
    extend_to: end
    data_generator: |
      return entity.attributes.data.map((entry) => {
        return [new Date(entry.start_time), entry.price_per_kwh];
      });
```

See [this Show & Tell post](https://github.com/mampfes/ha_epex_spot/discussions/110) for a fancier, more elaborate version of this card that can auto-hide the next day's prices when they aren't available, colour the hourly bars depending on the price, etc.

**Assumptions:**

This example assumes that you are using smartENERGY.at as a source and want to display the Net Price in €/kWh for the next 48 hours. The value for `entity` and the `entry` being processed by the `data_generator` are specific to this data source:

![Apex Chart Data Source Example](/images/apexcharts-entities-example.png)

If you are using a different source, you will need to first update `sensor.epex_spot_data_net_price` to use the correct sensor for your configuration (check which Entities you have available under Devices → Integrations → EPEX Spot → `#` Entities) and then change `entry.price_per_kwh` to the attribute that you want to use from your sensor of choice. If your data source does not report prices for the next day, you can change the `graph_span` to `24h` to get rid of the empty space that this configuration would create.

### 2. How can I optimise the best moment to start appliances?

It might be an interesting use case to know what the hours with lowest consecutive prices during the day are. This might be of value when looking for the most optimum time to start your washing machine, dishwasher, dryer, etc. The most convenient way to do this would be to install and configure the [EPEX Spot Sensor](https://github.com/mampfes/ha_epex_spot_sensor "EPEX Spot Sensor") (via HACS).

#### Example 1: Manually starting / scheduling a "dumb" dishwasher**

- Your dishwasher cycle takes 3 hours and 15 minutes to run
- You want to run a full, continuous cycle in the time-window when power is the cheapest for those 3 hours & 15 minutes
- You don't care at what exact time the dishwasher cycle starts or finishes

#### Create & Configure a Helper

Create a Helper by going to Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers → Create Helper → EPEX Spot Sensor and configure it like so:

![Dishwasher Config Example](/images/epex-spot-sensor-dishwasher-config-example.png)

This creates a binary sensor `binary_sensor.dishwasher_cheapest_window` with the Friendly Name "Dishwasher: Cheapest Window". The sensor turns on at the start of the cheapest time-window, off at the end of the time-window, and reports the `start_time` & `end_time` for this time-window in its attributes.

![Dishwasher Sensor Example](/images/epex-spot-sensor-dishwasher-sensor-example.png)

Depending on your implementation use-case, there are two ways to proceed:

**Case 1: Automating the dishwasher with a smart-plug**
If the dishwasher resumes it's wash cycle after a power loss, you can use a smart-plug to cut power the to the dishwasher as soon as it starts and then restore power to it when `binary_sensor.dishwasher_cheapest_window` turns on.

**Case 2: Manually starting / scheduling the dishwasher**
If you don't have a smart-plug or if your dishwasher won't resume after a power loss, you can create a card on your dashboard that tells you either what time, or in how much time you should should manually start your dishwasher or schedule it to start.

_What time should I start the dishwasher?_
Create a Template Sensor by going to Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers → Create Helper → Template → Template a sensor. Give it a Friendly name, for example "Next Dishwasher Start (Time)" and under "State Template", enter

```yaml
{% set data = state_attr('binary_sensor.dishwasher_cheapest_window', 'data') %}
{% set now = now() %}
{% set future_windows = data | selectattr('start_time', '>', now.timestamp() | timestamp_local) | list %}
{% if future_windows %}
  {% set next_window = future_windows | first %}
  {% set start_time = strptime(next_window['start_time'], '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z') %}
  {{ start_time.strftime('%H:%M on %d/%m/%y') }}
{% else %}
  Waiting for new data
{% endif %}
```

This Template Sensors uses the data from the attributes of the "Dishwasher: Cheapest Window" binary sensor created earlier with the EPEX Spot Sensor integration, checks whether the `start_time` is in the future, and displays the `start_time` as `H:M` on `d/m/y`.

_In how much time from now should I start the dishwasher?_
Create a Template Sensor by going to Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers → Create Helper → Template → Template a sensor. Give it a Friendly name, for example "Next Dishwasher Start (Duration)" and under "State Template", enter

```yaml
{% set data = state_attr('binary_sensor.dishwasher_cheapest_window', 'data') %}
{% set now = now() %}
{% set future_windows = data | selectattr('start_time', '>', now.timestamp() | timestamp_local) | list %}
{% if future_windows %}
  {% set next_window = future_windows | first %}
  {% set start_time = strptime(next_window['start_time'], '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z') %}
  {% set time_to_start = (start_time - now).total_seconds() %}
  {% set hours = (time_to_start // 3600) | int %}
  {% set minutes = ((time_to_start % 3600) // 60) | int %}
  {% set time_str = '{:02}:{:02}'.format(hours, minutes) %}
  {{ time_str }}
{% else %}
  Waiting for new data
{% endif %}
```

In addition to what the previous sensor does, this one calculates how long it is from `now` till the `start_time`, and displays the result in `H:M`.

In both cases, if the `start_time` has already passed, the sensors display `Waiting for new data`.

Finally, create Entity Cards on your dashboard with the sensors you want to display.

![Dishwasher Card Examples](/images/dishwasher-card-examples.png)

See [this Show & Tell post](https://github.com/mampfes/ha_epex_spot/discussions/111) for a fancier, more elaborate version of this card that can show several appliances at once, auto hide ones that don't have data, and even hide itself when there is no data at all.

#### Example 2: Automating a Home-Assitant-Connected Washer/Dryer
- The appliance reports how long each cycle takes to Home Assistant
- The appliance can be remote-controlled via Home Assistant 
- You want to run a full, continuous cycle in the time-window when power is the cheapest.
- You don't want a cycle to end after 11 pm.

Let's say that the entity that tells Home Assistant how long the current cycle is going to take is called `aeg_washer_dryer_timetoend`. You could create a Home Assistant automation that, triggers, for example, as soon as the appliance starts, pauses the appliance, uses a service call to find out when the appliance should be resumed, and then resumes the appliance at the right time.
Here's what such an automation may look like:

```yaml
mode: single
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id:
      #Replace this with whatever entity reports the appliance's state to HA.
      - sensor.aeg_washer_dryer_appliancestate
    from: Ready To Start
    to: Running
conditions: []
actions:
  - action: button.press
    metadata: {}
    data: {}
    target:
      #Replace this with your appliance's Pause command.
      entity_id: button.aeg_washer_dryer_executecommand_pause
  - data:
      #Replace this with your EPEX Spot Sensor's Device ID.
      device_id: 586b828bc8000a04c65aec0c9cc76503
      duration:
         #Replace the sensor with whichever one your appliance has to report the duration of the cycle.
         #The sensor in this example reports the duration only in minutes.
        hours: 0
        minutes: "{{ states('sensor.aeg_washer_dryer_timetoend') | int }}" 
        seconds: 0
    #You can name this variable whatever you want.
    #Just make sure you use the same variable name in the rest of the automation.    
    response_variable: cheapest_window 
    action: epex_spot.get_lowest_price_interval
  - wait_template: >-
      {{ cheapest_window is defined and as_timestamp(cheapest_window.start) |
      int > 0 }}
    continue_on_timeout: true
  - delay:
      seconds: >
        {% set wait = as_timestamp(cheapest_window.start) - as_timestamp(now())
        %} {{ [wait, 0] | max | int }}
  - action: button.press
    metadata: {}
    data: {}
    target:
      #Replace this with your appliance's Pause command.
      entity_id: button.aeg_washer_dryer_executecommand_resume 
```
See [this Show & Tell post](https://github.com/mampfes/ha_epex_spot/discussions/206) for a fancier, more elaborate version of this automation that has logging, notifications, manual overrides, etc.

### 3. I want to combine and view everything

Here's another [ApexCharts](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card) example.
It shows the price for the current day, the next day and the `min/max` value for each day.
Furthermore, it also fills the hours during which prices are lowest (see 2.)

![apexchart](/images/apex_advanced.png)

```yaml
type: custom:apexcharts-card
header:
  show: false
graph_span: 48h
span:
  start: day
now:
  show: true

**Assumptions:**

This example assumes that you are using the EPEX Spot Web Scraper as a source and want to display the Price in €/kWh for the next 48 hours, and highlight a 4-hour block where the electricity price is the lowest. As with the previous example, the `entity` and the `entry` being processed by the `data_generator` are specific to this data source, and you should update them to match your configuration.

In case the electricity pricing in your market results in the entire sparkline having one static colour (for example, the line always appears magenta), you will need to fine-tune the `color_threshold` entries . You can do this by either editing the `value` entries in the example above, or you can also add more `value` and `color` pairs if you want additional colours.

To change the colour of the highlighted cheapest time-period, update the `color` entry under `type: area`, and to change the length of the time-period, change the `+4` at the end of the `data_generator`.
